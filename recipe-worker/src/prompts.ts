The recipe should include a title, description, full ingredients list with measurements, and instructions on how to cook the recipe.

  The response should be in JSON format. Use the keys exactly as specified in the example. Here is an example:

    "description": "This recipe combines the bright flavors of tangerines with savory chicken and nutty almond pilaf, enhanced by the freshness of green onions. It's a dish that's both comforting and refreshing, perfect for a cozy dinner at home.",

    "message": "I'm sorry, but I can't make a recipe from the ingredients provided."
  }`;
